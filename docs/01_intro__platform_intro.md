**GoodData Platform** is a powerful end-to-end analytics platform as a service with multi-tenant distribution that scales to hundreds of terabytes of data and hundreds of thousands of users. Learn more about the [GoodData platform](https://help.gooddata.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=34341327) and how to [embed its analytics possibilities](https://help.gooddata.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=34340962).

## GoodData platform and GoodData.UI

* **GoodData REST API** is a low-level API that makes the platform features accessible to all GoodData users.

* **GoodData JS** is a set of JavaScript wrappers written on top of the *REST API*. Additionally, GoodData JS handles authentication, unified query request format (AFM, [Attributes-Measures-Filters](50_custom__execution.md)), and many more.

* **GoodData.UI** is a React-based JavaScript library for building responsive analytical applications. This library is written on top of *GoodData JS* and makes creating analytical applications even more convenient by adding visual components (listed in the left panel under **Visual Components**).

## Main concepts

Imagine you are an account manager for a Franchise network. You want to know the **average daily amount** of money for each **Franchise office** in the **USA**.

Let's introduce the main concepts:

* A **measure** is a computational expression that aggregates one or more numerical values. In this example, you are interested in the **average daily amount**.
* An **attribute** breaks the measure apart and provides context to the data. In this example, the measure is sliced by the **location** of the Franchise offices.
* A **filter** is a set of conditions that removes specific values from your original data. In this example, you want to see only **USA-specific locations**.

Let's display your data as a column chart:

![Column Chart](assets/intro_column_chart.png "Column Chart")

The chart shows the elements (measure, attribute, filter) that together work as unified input for creating a **visualization** using GoodData.UI, which is a view into a specific part of your data.

In the column chart:

* `$ Avg Daily Total Sales` is a **measure**.
* `Location State` is an **attribute**.
* A **filter** applied to the chart shows only USA-specific values of `Location State`, which represent the offices located in the USA.
